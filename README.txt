Project start date: June 12th, 2014

Play Texas Hold'em against AI opponents. Make sure you run in Terminal for
Mac so that the basic interface works.

Currently only random_AI available (makes decisions irrespective of cards held
but has some reasoning process so raises/calls are at least somewhat reasonable)

To Do:

- Create a getComboSequenceFast() function and benchmark it against the more laborious
  manually calculated version
