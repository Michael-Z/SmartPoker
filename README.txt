Project start date: June 12th, 2014

Currently a work in progress, my goal is to make an extremely stripped down 
interface for playing Texas Hold'em, a program for running the game and a
computer AI which can make decisions based on beliefs about the unknown cards
and likelihood of success at each point in the game.

I'm not entirely sure how well this will turn out, but anyone is free to watch
the progress!

To Do:

- Finish coding newHand() function
- Player/PlayerInfo unit tests
- Setup basic terminal interface for play
- Add human/AI classes
